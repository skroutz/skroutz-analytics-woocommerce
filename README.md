## FAQ

##### Which sites do you support?
We support Skroutz.gr

##### Where can I find the plugin's settings?
This plugin will add the settings to the WooCommerce Integration tab `WooCommerce > Settings > Integration > Skroutz Analytics`

##### Where can I find the `Shop Account ID`?
Visit skroutz for [merchants page][10], and navigate to the Skroutz Analytics section. Otherwise you may contact your account manager.

##### I don't see the code on my site. Where is it?
Make sure you have set your Skroutz Analytics `Shop Account ID` in the plugin settings, otherwise the tracking won't work.

##### How can I test if Skroutz Analytics is working?
Skroutz provides you a temporary `verification page` during the testing phase of the skroutz analytics integration. You can visit skroutz for [merchants page][10] or contact your account manager.

##### Which pages do you track?
This plugin does not track any admin pages, only frontend pages.

##### My code is there, but does not report any ecommece data. Why?
Duplicate Skroutz Analytics code causes a conflict in tracking. Remove any other Skroutz Analytics plugins or code from your site to avoid duplication and conflicts in tracking.

##### The order tax seems to be wrong. Why?
The plugin uses the WooCommerce tax rates you have configured in the settings. If the `Enable Taxes` option is disabled, or there are no `Tax Rates` configured, a default tax rate based on the flavor/country will be used to manually the calculate the order tax from the order revenue. So to avoid that, you need to properly setup your tax rules:

* Make sure you have enabled the `Enabled Taxes` option under `WooCommerce > Settings > Tax > Tax Options`
* And you have added **at least one** `Standard Tax Rate` under `WooCommerce > Settings > Tax > Standard Rates`
* Finally the shipping tax should be included in the order tax.
    - Make sure the `Shipping checkbox` is checked in the Tax Rates table (see above)
    - Also the `Tax Status` under `WooCommerce > Settings > Shipping > Flat Rate` must be set to `Taxable`. Note that the `Cost` value should be set excluding tax, as the tax will be automatically applied by WooCommerce. For example if you want the shipping cost to be 5 euro, you should set the cost to 4.03, given a 24% rate tax. The same applies for all the shipping methods that are enabled for your eshop.

##### I don't use neither product ID nor SKU in XML, but a custom postmeta id
The option to use a custom postmeta id is supported. You have to check the `Use custom postmeta id` option in the plugin settings, and then specify the custom id key used in the postmeta table. Note that if the custom id is not found for a product the product id/sku will be used instead.

##### I have variable products with multiple attributes that must be grouped by an attribute (e.g. color) in XML. What can I do?
Select the option `Send parent Unique ID combined with specified variation attribute term IDs` in the plugin settings and specify in the select box the grouping attribute (e.g. color). You can set more that one grouping attributes. But note that the order in which the attributes are set in the settings also affects the generated Unique ID.

The Unique ID that will be generated is a combination of the parent product ID and the specified grouping attribute terms:
`<parent product ID>-<grouping attribute term1 ID>-...-<grouping attribute termN ID>`.

The following rules apply:

* If a product is not a variant the `<product ID>` is used.
* If a product is a variant and does not have one of the declared color attributes the `<parent product ID>` is used.
* If a product is a variant and has one of the specified grouping attributes the `<parent product ID>-<attribute term ID>` is used.
* If a product is a variant and has two of the specified grouping attributes the `<parent product ID>-<attribute1 termA ID>-<attribute2 termB ID>` is used.

##### Global object name `skroutz_analytics` is already being used, can I change it?
The option to use a custom global object name is supported. You have to check theÂ `Use custom global object name`Â option in the plugin settings, and then specify a name in the text field.

##### How can I integrate the Product Reviews service?
The plugin provides two WordPress Widgets, that you can easily add:

* [Product Reviews Inline Widget](https://developer.skroutz.gr/partner_sku_reviews/#inline-widget)
* [Product Reviews Extended Widget](https://developer.skroutz.gr/partner_sku_reviews/#extended-widget)

You can find detailed documentation on how to integrate the widgets [here](https://developer.skroutz.gr/partner_sku_reviews/wordpress_widgets/).
